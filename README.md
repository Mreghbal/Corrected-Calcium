# Corrected-Calcium
Python code that calculates the Corrected Calcium in actual condition.
In this code, the calculate_corrected_calcium function takes two arguments: calcium and albumin. It applies a correction formula to account for the influence of albumin on calcium levels. The correction factor is 0.8, and it multiplies the difference between the reference albumin level (4.0 g/dL) and the measured albumin level. This correction value is then added to the measured calcium level to obtain the Corrected Calcium level.

In the example usage section, I've provided sample values for calcium_level and albumin_level, and called the calculate_corrected_calcium function with these values. The calculated Corrected Calcium level is then printed as output.

Note: This code assumes that the input values are provided in the correct units (mg/dL and g/dL respectively) and the correction formula used is appropriate for your actual condition.
