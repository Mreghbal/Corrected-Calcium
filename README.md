# Corrected Calcium Calculator

This repository contains a Python script that calculates the corrected calcium level based on the measured calcium and albumin levels. The corrected calcium level takes into account the influence of albumin calcium levels, providing a more accurate assessment of calcium status in the body.

## Introduction
Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various processes in the body, including bone health, muscle contraction, and nerve function. However, the total calcium level measured in blood may not accurately reflect the biologically active form of calcium due to its binding with proteins, particularly albumin.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the blood and acts as a carrier for many substances, including calcium. When albumin levels deviate from the reference range, it can affect the total calcium measurement. To account for this, a correction formula is applied to calculate the corrected calcium level, which provides a more accurate representation of theologically active calcium concentration.

## Calculation Formula
The corrected calcium level is calculated using the following formula:

```
corrected_calcium = calcium + (0.8 * (albumin_ref - albumin))
```

Where:
- `calcium` is the measured calcium level in mg/dL.
- `albumin` is the measured albumin level in g/dL.
- `albumin_ref` is the reference albumin level in g/dL.
- `0.8` is the correction factor for calcium.

The correction factor of 0.8 is commonly used to estimate the change in calcium for each 1 g/dL change in albumin. By multiplying the difference between the reference albumin level and the measured albumin level by this correction factor, we can determine the adjustment needed for the calcium level.

## Usage
To use the corrected calcium calculator, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.0 or above).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `corrected_calcium.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```
   python corrected_calcium.py
   ```

5. Enter the measured calcium level when prompted.
6. Enter the measured albumin level when prompted.
7. The script will calculate the corrected calcium level and display the result.

## Example
Let's consider an example demonstrate the usage of the corrected calcium calculator. Suppose we have the following measurements:

- Measured Calcium Level: 9.2 mg/dL
- Measured Albumin Level: 3.5 g/dL

Running the script with these values will yield the following output:

```
Measured Calcium Level: 9.2 mg/dL
Measured Albumin Level: 3.5 g/dL

Corrected Calcium: 9.6 mg/dL
```

 calculated corrected calcium level is 9.6 mg/dL, which takes into account the influence of albumin on calcium levels.

## Dependencies
The corrected calcium calculator script does not have any external dependencies. It only requires Python 3.0 or above to be installed on your system.
